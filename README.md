# Tampermonkey Scripts for Property Listing Websites

This repository contains some userscripts that enhance the user experience on property listing websites.

## Scripts

- **[Real Estate Folder](real-estate-folder/README.md):** A userscript that lets you hide real estate listings you're
  not interested in by toggling them open or closed. It supports popular property listing websites such
  as [realestate.com.au](https://www.realestate.com.au/) and [domain.com.au](https://www.domain.com.au/).
- **[Better Property](better-property/README.md):** A userscript that enhances the user experience on property listing
  websites by sorting property sections and hiding specific elements. This script is particularly useful for users who
  want a cleaner and more organized view of property details.
- **[Better Real Estate](better-real-estate/README.md):** A userscript that adds two buttons to
  navigate to the property listing page at [property.com.au](https://property.com.au)
  and [find the best house](https://findbesthouse.com.au) based on the property details.

## Installation

1. **Install a Userscript Manager:**  
   To use these scripts, you'll need a userscript manager such as [Tampermonkey](https://www.tampermonkey.net/) or
